                My aspiration is to become a well-rounded full stack developer, with a particular passion for website
                development. I have collaborated on numerous projects in the past, tackling both frontend and backend
                tasks,
                either solo or with a partner. While I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JS, I must admit that design is
                not
                my
                strongest suit. That being said, I am generally more confident in my backend abilities, and I prefer to
                follow a
                server-side render model, with Laravel being my preferred framework.

            </div>
            <div>
                In the future, I plan to broaden my
                horizons and learn NextJS, allowing me to shift my focus to client-side rendering. I heard about API
                term many times but I just use built-in API and
                never create them following REST API rule, so when I learn NextJS I could use Laravel to create RESTFUL
                API
                and use NextJS to fetch them . Ultimately, my goal
                is to turn my passion for development into a viable career as a full stack developer.
